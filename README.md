I developed an interactive game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The objective of the game is simple: you need to guess a number that was randomly generated by the computer, which can be between 0 and 100. 
You have a total of 10 attempts to get the number right. 
Test your luck and guessing skills to see if you can figure out the mystery number before your attempts run out!
